# Hi I'm Jasmine: Design Engineer obsessed with crafting magical product experiences

I'm currently studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science @ UCI, however I spend most of my time flying to [hackathons](https://devpost.com/jaslavie) (18 hackathons in 2024!), organizing a 48 hour [design-a-thon](https://designatuci.com/designathon/24), and building electric race cars @ [FSAE](https://sites.uci.edu/uciracing/) üèéÔ∏è 

## ‚ú¶ What I specialize in ##
* Product Management: Leading a collegiate [Startup Incubator @ UCI](https://www.productuci.com/). Prev. won 1st overall in pitch competition.
* UI/UX Design: [leading a design team](https://ctc-uci.com/) to build pro bono products for NPOs.
* Embedded Systems: Developing AR Inerfaces for Spacesuits @ [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/spacesuit-user-interface-technologies-for-students/)

I also speak about design and tech at [Deisgn @ UCI](https://designatuci.com/), design for [NPO's](https://www.developforgood.org/), and share my life learnings through my [online platform](https://jaslavie.github.io/voicewise/). So far, I've hosted ~20 workshops and judged for two 10-week-long design competitions.
