# Hi I'm Jasmine: Product Designer, Front-end Dev, and WW2 Enthusiast #
🎓 Currently a cognitive science + computer science major @ UCI with an interest in web apps 💻, business strategy 💼, and designing for militaristic operations ✈️
<br>

### What I do: ###

* Design: UI/UX design with a heavy emphasis on complex, multi-faceted web applications for strategic operations + quick desicion making
* Front-end: Landing pages for products (usually what I do for hackathons), styling, animation, sass, react
* Product: Exploring Product marketing and PM roles (currently doing a fellowship w [UCI's startup incubator](https://www.productuci.com/))
* Other things that bring me joy: hosting workshops for [Deisgn @ UCI](https://designatuci.com/), organizing designathons (hackathon for design), designing for [NPO's](https://www.developforgood.org/), and [sharing my life learnings](https://jaslavie.github.io/voicewise/)


### Tech Stack: ###

I prefer SASS with react.js for front-end. I work purely with Figma for design.
<br>
However, I also have experience with:
* Styling: tailwind, mui, chakra ui, vanilla css
* Structure: vanilla HTML, typescript
* Other: Blender, R, three.js
<br>
What I'm learning right now:
* VR developmnet with Unity/Unreal Engine
* Reading on ML research papers and intersections with design
