# Hi I'm Jasmine: Product Designer and Engineer Building 0 → 1

I'm currently studying cognitive science, computer science, and business @ UCI, however I spend most of my time flying to [hackathons](https://devpost.com/jaslavie) (18 hackathons in 2024!), organizing a 48 hour [design-a-thon](https://designatuci.com/designathon/24), and reading contrary research ☕️ 

## ✦ What I specialize in ##
* Design-side: [leading a design team](https://ctc-uci.com/) to build a 0 to 1 product for an NPO
* Engineering-side: Incoming Design Engineer at [NASA](https://www.lspace.asu.edu/)'s 12-week accelerator program
* Product: Product Manager for [Product Fellowship](https://www.productuci.com/)), won 1st overall in pitch competition

I also speak about design and tech at [Deisgn @ UCI](https://designatuci.com/), design for [NPO's](https://www.developforgood.org/), and share my life learnings through my [online platform](https://jaslavie.github.io/voicewise/). So far, I've hosted ~20 workshops and judged for two 10-week-long design competitions.


## ✦ Tech Stack: ##
I prefer SASS with react.js for front-end. I work purely with Figma for design.

However, I also have experience with:
* Front-end: tailwind, mui/chakra ui, vanilla css, vanilla HTML, typescript, react native
* Other: Blender, Unity3D (VR), R, three.js
