# Hi I'm Jasmine: Product Designer, Front-end Dev, and WW2 Enthusiast #

🎓 Currently a first-year **cognitive science + computer science** major @ UCI with an interest in web apps 💻, business strategy 💼, and designing for data-heavy operations ✈️
<br><br>
🐇 I love **fast-paced startup ecosystems** with multi-faceted products that drive rapid decision-making
<br><br>
🚀 My end goal is to work in the military/defense and data space!
<br><br>
🧠 MBTI: `INTP`



## ✦ What I do ##

* Design: UI/UX design with a heavy emphasis on complex, multi-faceted web applications for strategic operations + quick desicion making
* Front-end: Landing pages for products (usually what I do for hackathons), styling, animation, sass, react
* Product: Exploring Product marketing and PM roles (currently doing a fellowship w [UCI's startup incubator](https://www.productuci.com/))
* Other things that bring me joy: hosting workshops for [Deisgn @ UCI](https://designatuci.com/), organizing [designathons](https://designatuci.com/designathons/) (hackathon for design), designing for [NPO's](https://www.developforgood.org/), and [sharing my life learnings](https://jaslavie.github.io/voicewise/)
